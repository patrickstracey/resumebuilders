# Resume Builders

_This project was done in 2020_

A job board for early career and internship opportunities built with Vue3 utilzing Google's Firebase for the back-end and storage.

I really enjoyed working with both Vue and Firebase in this project but found myself doing some wacky feeling stuff with VueX pretty quickly to help keep my Firebase reads down. I'd be curious how Vue is implemented in larger scale environments, are companies building front-ends purely with Vue? Or are they dropping Vue components into views provided by frameworks like Rails and Django when needed?
